# Implementation and evaluation of various cache replacement policies
- LRU, Least Recently Used
- LFUDA, Least Frequently Used Caches with Dynamic Aging
- LFU, Least Frequently Used
- GD, Greedy Dual
- GDS, Greedy Dual Size
- GDSF, Greedy Dual Size Frequency
- WGDSF - Weighted Greedy Dual Size Frequency
- GDSF-AI, Greedy Dual Size Frequency - 

CPU vs web cache
- web cached objects vary in size; cpu cache has a constant page size
- different access patterns
